## [Machine Learning Based Student Grade Prediction: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.08744.pdf)

### Key Words: CF, MF, RBM

* RBM: 
    *  Find out the structural pattern within the dataset.   
    *  predict the studets' performance in different courses.

First layer: Course Grades.  
Second Layer: symmetrically weighted connections.


> Used to fill the missing data in a studetn-course matrix.

<hr>

CF: Predict the student's _s_ garde in course _c_ by identifing student grades in same courses. 

* k-nearest neighbour is used to calculate the similarity students and courses.

MF:   
* SVD:       
   
   Funk SVD 

* NMF:
